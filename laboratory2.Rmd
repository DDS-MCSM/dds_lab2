## About the laboratory

This second laboratory assumes that the first laboratory has been entirely completed. Thus, most of the work will be done using the tools seen in the first one.

In case the first is not completed, it is encouraged for you to first complete the previous one, ask any doubts that may arise, and then, complete this one.
